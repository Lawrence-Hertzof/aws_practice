IPAM (IP Address Manager) Overview

IPAM is a feature provided by AWS to help you automate and manage IP address assignments and usage
across your AWS infrastructure. It provides a centralized interface to allocate and track IP addresses,
ensuring that you can efficiently manage IP space within and across VPCs,
AWS Regions, and even across multiple AWS accounts within an organization.
ipv4_ipam_pool_id

 - The ipv4_ipam_pool_id parameter is used when creating a VPC.
It allows you to specify the ID of an IPv4 IPAM pool from which the VPC's CIDR block (IP address range)
will be allocated.

 - IPAM Pool: An IPAM pool is a collection of CIDR blocks managed by IPAM. It acts as a source of IP addresses
 that you can use to allocate IP ranges to various network resources like VPCs, subnets, etc.

 - Automated Management: By specifying an ipv4_ipam_pool_id, you allow IPAM to automatically manage and assign 
a CIDR block to the VPC from the specified pool, making it easier to manage IP address space without manual allocation.
